## zsh plan September 2020

- macOS ships with zsh
- can zsh update itself? if so, do that
- do we have git? do we need developer tools for that or something? would brew install it and manage it, or vice-versa?
- install brew. script it?
  + nah
- hammerspoon and the shift-it spoon
- flycut

- pegasus
  - with the environment-setup script
  - and build etc.

- Antigen?
- oh-my-zsh?
  - customize?
- port dot-files from bash to zsh?
