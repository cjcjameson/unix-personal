## zsh plan September 2020

- macOS ships with zsh
- can zsh update itself? if so, do that
- do we have git? do we need developer tools for that or something? would brew install it and manage it, or vice-versa?
- install brew. script it?
  + nah
- hammerspoon and the shift-it spoon
- flycut

- pegasus
  - with the environment-setup script
  - and build etc.

- Antigen?
- oh-my-zsh?
  - customize?
- port dot-files from bash to zsh?

- vim tabs vs. spaces behavior


### Path

export PATH="$PATH":/Users/cjameson/go/bin:/Users/cjameson/workspace/unix-personal/bin

### iTerm?

So far, don't need it. I remember liking it for "ctrl-click" to open a link.
But the default macOS behavior is ctrl-double-click accomplishes the same, so
not worth it
